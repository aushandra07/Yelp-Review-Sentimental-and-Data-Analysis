# Yelp-Reviews-Sentimental-and-Data-Analysis
This project is a hands-on learning exercise where I build a complete data analytics pipeline using Python, Amazon S3, and Snowflake. The goal is to understand how raw data moves through a modern data stackâ€”from ingestion to analysis.<br>

What This Project Covers :<br>
Data Preprocessing with Python<br>
Split a large JSON file into smaller, more manageable chunks for faster and more efficient ingestion.<br>

Cloud Storage with AWS S3<br>
Upload the processed files to Amazon S3 to stage them for loading into Snowflake.<br>

Data Warehousing with Snowflake<br>
Load the data from S3 into Snowflake tables for structured storage and querying.<br>

Data Analysis with SQL<br>
Use SQL in Snowflake to explore the dataset and answer meaningful analytical questions.<br>

Why I am Doing This :<br>
This project is part of my personal learning journey to gain hands-on experience with real-world data engineering and analytics workflows. It helps me understand how different tools integrate to support scalable, cloud-based data pipelines.
