This project is a hands-on learning exercise where I build a complete data analytics pipeline using Python, Amazon S3, and Snowflake. The goal is to understand how raw data moves through a modern data stackâ€”from ingestion to analysis.

What This Project Covers :
Data Preprocessing with Python
Split a large JSON file into smaller, more manageable chunks for faster and more efficient ingestion.

Cloud Storage with AWS S3
Upload the processed files to Amazon S3 to stage them for loading into Snowflake.

Data Warehousing with Snowflake
Load the data from S3 into Snowflake tables for structured storage and querying.

Data Analysis with SQL
Use SQL in Snowflake to explore the dataset and answer meaningful analytical questions.

Why I am Doing This :
This project is part of my personal learning journey to gain hands-on experience with real-world data engineering and analytics workflows. It helps me understand how different tools integrate to support scalable, cloud-based data pipelines.
